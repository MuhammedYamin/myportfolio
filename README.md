# Muhammed Yamin — Portfolio (scaffold)

This is a minimal scaffold for a portfolio site built with Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + MDX (planned).

Folder: `yamin-portfolio`

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd yamin-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes
- The project files were created as a scaffold. You need to run `npm install` to fetch packages before `npm run dev` will work.
- Tailwind, MDX, and other dependencies are declared in `package.json`. If you prefer yarn or pnpm, adjust accordingly.
- Contact form currently posts to `/api/contact` and logs submissions server-side. Wire SendGrid or Formspree for production delivery.

What's included
- Basic pages: Home, About, Projects, Contact
- Project data in `src/lib/projects.ts` using your provided project text and links
- Placeholder SVG images in `public/images/projects/*` — replace these with real screenshots (recommended size: 1600×900)

Next steps I can do for you
- Replace placeholders with uploaded screenshots and optimize them
- Add MDX blog pages and example posts
- Wire SendGrid (or Formspree) for contact delivery and validation
- Deploy to Vercel and add domain configuration

Tell me which of those you want next and I'll continue.
